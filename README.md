<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Federico</h1>
<h3 align="center">Data Science Student | Statistical Thinker</h3>

<p align="center">
Double Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Padua and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, with a background in Statistics and Information Management and a strong focus on applied machine learning and experimental rigor.
</p>

- 🔭 I’m currently:
  - Maintaining and improving open-source ML implementations on GitHub, including methods such as Friedman's Regularized Discriminant Analysis.

- 🎓 Education:
  - Double Master Degree in Data Science – University of Padua & Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (2024 – current).
  - BSc in Statistics and Information Management – University of Milan-Bicocca.

- 🧪 Some recent projects and research:
  - Benchmarked 20+ categorical encoders on 10+ tabular datasets in supervised learning, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility and rigorous evaluation.
  - Implemented distributed k-means (Lloyd’s algorithm) and a fair variant in PySpark, plus streaming frequency estimation with Count-Min Sketch vs Count Sketch.
  - Built NLP pipelines with Transformers, BERT, and RAG for tasks like text classification, fake-news detection, and domain-specific question answering.

- 💡 What I enjoy:
  - Turning messy, real-world data into clear insights and robust models, from implementation of ML algorithms to recommender systems and optimization.
  - Bridging theory and practice through open, reproducible experiments and clean, well-documented code.
